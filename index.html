                    Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I will share a little information about myself about my journey up until this point in
                    my life. I was born in Las Vegas, Nevada.. yes you heard me correct. Typically what happens in Vegas
                    stays in Vegas, but look I made it to Arizona. I grew up on the fence of Phoenix and Scottsdale, Arizona
                    with my mother. In my upbringing, I was surrounded by family selling real estate and being successful
                    doing whatever they were doing. I knew that when I grew up this is exactly what I wanted to be.. successful.
                    <br>
                    <br> Now , over the years I have found new meaning to what success is and to many people where it could be
                    either power, wealth, passion, a big house, or even married. These are all great success points, but
                    what really stood out to me was passion. I knew that I wanted to be successful doing something that I
                    loved, but discovering that was difficult without dipping your toes in the waters of many pools. I found
                    my passion while I was in college at the W.P. Carey School of Business, which is one of the many schools
                    located at Arizona State University, but I did not graduate with my passion in mind because my degree
                    focus was in Business Communication at the time and my only thought was to finish.
                    <br>
                    <br> I came across a resource to where I could create something of my own, which turned out to be coding.
                    I was teaching myself while I was in class. I loved it immediately because my interests have always been
                    to be creating something somewhere. For a while I thought I was going to be an architect but in the world
                    of making choices, my path has taken me here: a heavy interest in coding and the desire to create. I
                    am now in the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp. I do have an active life where I will spend time with 
                    friends and my soon to be wife.
                    <br>
                    <br> I enjoy a variety of things whether it might be:
                    <ul style="color: rgb(99, 63, 146); font-weight: bold;">
                        <li>Going to the gym</li>
                        <li>Hiking with friends</li>
                        <li>Playing video games</li>
                        <li>Going to see the latest movies</li>
                        <li>Occasionally trying out new restaurants</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="padding: 20px; text-align: center">I am very excited to see where the future will take me and I
                        can't wait <br>to code up a storm... that reminds me I need to get back to it!</p>
